## MetadataRepository that could not be found

After starting the project, an error occurred indicating that the `MetadataRepository` implementation class could not be found.

![MetadataRepositoryNotBeFound](../../../public/image/MetadataRepositoryNotBeFound.jpg)

This class is an interface for reading and writing file metadata, and only the interface is defined in the open-source component. 
You need to write the implementation class yourself in the project. 
Refer to the [*Quick Start*](../user/quick-start) section on *File Metadata Reading and Writing Implementation* for details.
